Principal Component Analysis
Final Project 
Artificial Intelligence 
	This was a project that I worked on the Artificial Intelligence class. The objective of this project was to learn more about the PCA algorithm. This algorithm is widely used nowadays and is one of the algorithms that Google Lenses use. PCA transforms large set of variables by keeping only the most significant ones. When working with very big datasets, this algorithm is very helpful not only because it extracts the features that have the highest correlation on the dataset, but it also helps with data visualization. In this assignment, the Iris dataset was used, and the classification algorithm is KNN from sklearn library. 
	Working on this project helped me in advancing my proficiency in programming with Python, its libraries as well as writing more efficient code. It also gave me the opportunity to explore more AI on my own and how powerful it can be in real-life problems. I was able to connect all the knowledge I got from the class in one project and that is why it was a valuable assignment for me.

Bitcoin prediction based on previous data 
Final Project 
Data Mining 

	This project was a final project on the data mining class. We were responsible for finding a real-life problem and come up with a solution based on the algorithms we had implemented in class. In most of the classes we learn about the technologies and solving problems with it, but here we worked with a project/problem that everyone would be interested in knowing the outcome. We worked on the problem, decided on the features that were the most important for a good model, implemented the best algorithms to find the one that works best with the best accuracy score, and finally we did data visualization. All these are very important knowledge to have at any job.

Chatroom  
Final Project 
Networks 
	This project is the final project on the network class. In this class we learned about the OSI model, how to work with sockets, web servers, proxy, how to keep multiple connections in one server etc. This assignment in the end was a sum up of everything what we had done in class. We were responsible on creating our own protocol and then program it in the language that we prefer. I worked with a friend on this, and I did the server and she did the client. At the end of the semester, couple groups tested their chatroom by one individual starting up the server, and other students connect to his/her sever. This is all possible because we had implemented the same chatroom. 
It was very fun to see the chatroom work and, in the end, to be able to connect to one another chatroom. This assignment required a lot of thinking on how all pieces would fit together, understand what to implement as part of the application layer and what for the network layer.

Hangman 
Homework 5 
Algorithms and Data Structures 

	I chose this assignment because it was one of the first intense assignment I did in college. It was a homework on my data structure class 202 and at that time I did have a lot of experience in coding or in algorithms. This assignment takes a list of words and runs an algorithm to play the hangman game. The user has only 6 lives. Later on the year, we did another assignment for the cheating hangman. 
Both these helped me to choose the best data structure that would work on this by thinking on the efficiency of the program. Not only I advance my coding skills, but I also understood better the meaning of the Big O notation. I coded in Java which is an object-oriented language and I learned how to design, write and test programs that use these types of languages.

Project 
Software Engineering 	
	
	This is one of my favorite projects in Westminster. This because it was like a real work place. We worked on a group of 4 and we delivered a software that teaches math to kindergartens by playing a game. Every two classes we would all stand up and talk in front of everyone what we had done during the week, if we had fulfilled the goals that our team had and what would we do next. This was a great technique because we would all be in a lot of pressure to do good because we were in front of the class and there were deadlines every month that needed to be fulfilled. A very interesting class and the project turned out to be functional. 
	The class taught how it is to learn new technologies on your own, (I learned Java Script and Django), work on teams, be responsible for my work and strictly respect deadlines. This was pure problem solving and projects like this always have a lot of impact on me.
